A new project that I've started on to distract me from Minecraft has been a text
editor that I've been creating in C. I attempted to emulate Vim keybinds because
Vim is great! This post isn't a tutorial but more of some notable features or
roadblocks I faced while working on it. Besides a couple of simple projects I
created using C, this is the first real big project I started to work on and it
had a lot of different parts that needed to work together for it to work. During
this time, I've learned a lot about how C is programmed, including C-styled API
design, memory allocation, and interesting behavior of text editors that are
small but significant.

# Memory Allocation

# C-styled APIs

# Cursor Movement
