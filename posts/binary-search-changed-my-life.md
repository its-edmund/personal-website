Okay not really but I wanted to talk about one of my favorite kind of Leetcode
problem. I learned this trick from a very smart friend of mine, who learned it
from a random Leetcode forum (I linked it in my previous post). Those who are
familiar with practicing Leetcode probably know these questions very well.
However, when I first learned about it, it changed the way I looked at solving
Leetcode problems.
