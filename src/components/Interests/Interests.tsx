      <h2>my interests</h2>
      <p>
        i have a lot of experiences in web development but through classes and personal projects,
        i've been exploring a lot more systems programming with c, c++, and rust. my threads for my
        cs program at georgia tech are systems & architecture and information internetworks. i chose
        these because i felt like i wanted to explore low level programming and learn more about
        computer networking in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        as much as i love programming, it's not the only thing i do in my free time. i love
        snowboarding, video games, and travelling. currently, i haven't had the time to get immersed
        in video games but i've put into countless hours into factorio, rainbow six siege, and civ
        6.
